This is a program which handles bad input whilst calculating how long it will take for someone's investment to be doubled.

The program should:
- Display a question that asks what the rate of return is to the user
- Get rate of return from user
- Don't allow 0
- Don't allow non-numeric values
- Trap bad input in a loop
- Divide rate of return by 72 to get the years it will take to return the investment.
